From the beggining mark zuckerberg had an idea and implemented it - to see the learning process: turn ideas into reality.

**Turn ideas into reality: Validated Learning**

"Friends though that one of these days this would be cool for the world" eventaully he found that hey I should do this.

Facebook - there was not analysis for the idea, they didn't set out but he created it then saw where it led. Almost as its good to build soemthing for the world for the process itself and to observe the reaction instead of trying to analyse what 'could be' the reaction.

**Build and Observer rathen than Overthinking**
