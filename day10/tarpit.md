# Tarpit comeback

Stay in the loop but have a piechart on what you spend time on...
- if its too much consuming content is more than actually building then that is bad
- Need to balance information consumption (critical real info) and Building
  - The most productive doers - don't spend time wasting on hacker NEWZ
- So just build

Do thigns that you find fun - do it for self satisfaction indulge
- Make something is usefull for yourself instead of reverse engineering the process
- Make something that is valuable for anyone
- Follow pasion

MVP:
- What do the words mean 
- Minimum: Least features
- Viable: This means someone finds it usefull or someone must use it because it just doens't exist
- Product: product something someone can obtain

Start of by making something usefull
- The simple test is are you using your own tool...
  - If you are in position of being your own user then its a higher bar

Set expecttions
- the ycombinator self own -- achieve x in y days this is the selfpwn roll

Know you customer 
- Is the tool for the company or the thing customer
- Talk to user, decision makrer, etc., talk and get feedback as soon as possible

Shorten the user and buy
