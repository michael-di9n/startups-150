People starting their startup parttime since conviction could be low

Investors want something that will grow quickly.. venture funding... How a investor can optimistically see how it could work. Startup idea is just a hypothesis for the investor on how it can grow quickly.


Problem, Solution and Insight

1. Good problems fit into one of these categories
   1. lots of people have, 
   2. Growing i.e., the space is hot
   3. Urgent
   4. Expensive to solve
   5. Mandatory: Requires to be solved
   6. Frequent: Encounter over and over again
      1. Frequency is important since the software has ability to convert many times

Solutions: Don't start here. i.e., dont think of a solution in search of a problem



Insight: 
1. What is somehting 'I' have personaly that can be better than other things

### Types of unfair advantages
1. Founder
   1. Are you 1 out of 10 of people in the world can solve this problem - i.e., are you an expert at something (a elit software developer doesn't count...)
2. Market
   1. Is the market growing alot per year (i.e., 20%) sorta weak advantage tho!
3. Product
   1. Is it 10x better than the previous thing
4. Aqcuisition
   1. Aqcuisition path that cost 0$ i.e., grows by word of mouth etc things that dont scale
5. Monotopoly
   1. As the company grows is it more difficult to get defeated (i.e., marketplace, network effect)



Whats the default for a company to succeed, i.e., can they even build it (if yes then the next is sales and proving it to other people)


The peorson use forms wufoo etc., some kind of form thing
