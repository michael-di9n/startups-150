# Key points
Most good startup ideas come from deep experetise in a subject. If you try and force an idea typically they will be good sounding but will ultimately fail

The three most important things are:
1. Learn alot about things  that matter (hard! not even paul knows what 'matters')
2. Work on problems that interest you (if they are boring then avoid it! startups are about preserverance above many)
3. Find people who you respect and you like - this is step from finding a co-founder

If anything two words:
**Just learn**

Eventaully whatever you are learning - that interest you will come back and be usefull; learn deeply.

Another sasying is to be on the edge of technology and live in the future if you learn deep enough then solving problems will be more 'natural' i.e., looking into the future.


The best way to learn how to start a startup is to just start a start up

Follow your curiousity and don't abandon the thing you like no matter how small - but be cognizant on stretching yourself dont go the easy path


**Just learn**
