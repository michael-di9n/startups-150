More tarpit ideas - A tarpit idea is something that sounds good but is a sticky mess and you die
1. Attracts alot applications but they never work


Now LLM's can make tarpit ideas better - since you can iterate so quick
1. Copilot for X 

This is another common idea for AI startup ideas

Flavours of tarpit
- Belief that the world should work in another way (very grandious - 'wouldn't it be cooler if all friends could co-ordinate on an app' ... some people also we have messenger)
- Arbritrage: Some form of get-rich-quick scheme; Do whatever is raising money

This is not a static list of ideas - technologies change'



#### Vibe Coding
Vibe coding is good to get the initial structure down or some kind a framework but eventually filling in the 'meat' will require getting down and dirty


## What young people should focus on
#### Side Projects 
- Build something before quiting your job
1. Experience new technology
2. Get experience with the release lifecycle
3. Do things for fun can make art, twitter bots
4. (don't do the sideproject when you on the job working haha)

#### Where you live
1. Who you are surrounded with and where you live just move!
